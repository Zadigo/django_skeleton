# Django Skeleton
A simple project that illustrates in a very simple manner how Django is initally setup starting from the `setup()` function.

The main registry populates itself with all registered apps and then uses the models of each apps as the pivotal point to update other instances in this order `Options`, `Field` and then `Manager` plus `MangerDescriptor`. The `Options` class also gets updated au et Ã  mesure as the sequence is run. 

The `settings` class is instanciated at the very top of `setup`.

To run or understand the sequence call or debug the `_init.py` file.
